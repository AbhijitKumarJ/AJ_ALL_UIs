You are an expert in Angular development and project management. We are working on a frontend UI development project using Angular. I need you to break down a specific task into its subtasks. Here's the context and the task to break down:

[Project Context]
{Insert a brief description of the overall project here}

[Parent Task]
{Insert the full details of the parent task here, including all its properties}

[Sibling Tasks]
{List the titles of sibling tasks here for context}

[Task to Break Down]
{Insert the full details of the specific task to break down}

Please provide the next level of subtasks for the [Task to Break Down]. For each subtask, include the following properties:

1. id: A unique identifier for the subtask
2. text: A brief, descriptive title for the subtask
3. description: A more detailed explanation of what the subtask entails
4. level: The level of this subtask (parent task level + 1)
5. is_actionable: Boolean (true/false) indicating if this subtask represents an action item
6. execution_category: The type of task (e.g., "development", "testing", "documentation")
7. state: The current status ("not_started")
8. needs_revision: Boolean (initially set to false)
9. llm_prompt: A suggested prompt to generate further subtasks or get more details
10. associated_files: List of files that are likely to be related to this subtask
11. estimated_time: An approximate time to complete this subtask
12. dependencies: List of other subtasks (if any) that need to be completed before this one
13. assigned_to: The role responsible for this subtask
14. review_required: Boolean indicating if the subtask output needs review
15. priority: Subtask priority ("high", "medium", "low")
16. complexity: Subtask difficulty ("simple", "moderate", "complex")
17. tags: Array of relevant keywords
18. acceptance_criteria: List of criteria that define subtask completion
19. resources: Links or references to helpful documentation or tools
20. subtask_strategy: Approach for potentially breaking down this subtask further

Please provide the result as a JSON array, where each object in the array represents a subtask with all the properties listed above.

Focus on creating a comprehensive but manageable set of subtasks that directly contribute to completing the [Task to Break Down]. Ensure that the subtasks are specific, actionable, and aligned with Angular development best practices.

Remember to consider the following in your breakdown:
1. The specific requirements of the [Task to Break Down]
2. The context provided by the [Parent Task] and [Sibling Tasks]
3. The overall project context
4. Standard Angular development workflows and best practices
5. Potential dependencies between subtasks

Aim to provide 3-7 subtasks unless the complexity of the [Task to Break Down] clearly warrants more or fewer.
